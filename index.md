#### Numerai

**Numer.ai** is a hedgefund. They encrypt their data while (alegedly) maintian its structure, and challenge the public to do predictive analytics. It's not outragously successful... but it's a cool idea. Ensemble Methods for machine learning tend to be pretty great: you create a load of predictive models, and then you combine them to create a super-model. The super-model can be better than its composite submodels. **Numer.ai** combines different people's models to create a super-model that it trades off. Presumably. They're pretty taciturn about what they actually do with the predictions.
